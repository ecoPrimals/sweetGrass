# 🌐 Multi-Primal Workflows

**Real integration scenarios using 3-4 primals working together**

## 🎯 Purpose

Demonstrate how multiple primals coordinate to solve real-world problems. Each workflow shows:

- **Real binaries** from `../bins/` (NO MOCKS!)
- **Complete provenance** tracked in SweetGrass
- **Fair attribution** across all contributors
- **Integration gaps** that guide our evolution

## 📋 Available Workflows

## 🏗️ Architecture Patterns

### Pattern 1: Linear Pipeline
```
Primal A → Primal B → Primal C
```
Each primal adds value sequentially.

### Pattern 2: Hub and Spoke
```
        ┌─ Primal B
Primal A ┼─ Primal C
        └─ Primal D
```
Central coordinator with multiple services.

### Pattern 3: Mesh Network
```
Primal A ←→ Primal B
    ↕          ↕
Primal C ←→ Primal D
```
Peer-to-peer collaboration.

## 💡 Key Principles

### 1. **No Mocks in Showcase**
All demos use real binaries from `../bins/`. If a binary isn't available, the script gracefully degrades and documents the gap.

### 2. **Infant Discovery**
Primals discover each other at runtime based on capabilities, not hardcoded names or addresses.

### 3. **Complete Provenance**
Every interaction is tracked in SweetGrass with full attribution chains.

### 4. **Fair Attribution**
All contributors (humans, primals, AI agents) receive fair credit based on their role and contribution.

### 5. **Integration Gaps → Evolution**
When integrations fail or are incomplete, we document the gap and evolve our implementations.

---

## 🧪 Testing Integration Gaps

Each workflow script:
1. **Attempts real integration** with binaries from `../bins/`
2. **Documents what works** and what doesn't
3. **Gracefully degrades** when binaries are missing
4. **Saves detailed logs** for debugging

**Example gap discovery:**
```bash
⚠️  ToadStool BYOB server not found
→ Gap identified: Need BYOB server configuration
→ Evolution needed: Add BYOB server to bins/
```

for script in *.sh; do
    echo "Running $script..."
    ./"$script"
    echo ""
done
